I'm afraid I have some bad news!

The text "Aucun texte extrait de l'image." means "No text extracted from the image." in French. This is likely because there was no actual text or information embedded in the image, and therefore, nothing to extract.

As a result, I cannot generate a detailed explanation of this figure based on the extracted text, as there is no text to work with!
