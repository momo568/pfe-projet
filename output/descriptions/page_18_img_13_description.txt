I apologize, but it seems that there is no text to extract from the image. The phrase "Aucun texte extrait de l'image" translates to "No text extracted from the image". This means that there is no text or information available about the figure in question.

If you can provide me with more context or additional information about the risk management document, I may be able to help you interpret the figure or provide a detailed explanation of what it represents. Alternatively, if you have any specific questions or concerns about risk management, I'll do my best to assist you.
