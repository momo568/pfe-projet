Unfortunately, without more context or information, it's difficult to provide a detailed explanation of the table. The extracted text "ig VS Créd" doesn't seem to contain any descriptive information about the table, such as its title, contents, or purpose.

However, I can try to make some educated guesses based on the text. Here are a few possibilities:

1. **Risk vs. Credit**: One possibility is that this table is comparing two types of risks: "ig" (which could stand for "insurance guarantee" or something similar) and "Créd" (possibly short for "credit risk"). The table might be showing how these two types of risks compare in terms of their impact, probability, or mitigation strategies.
2. **Investment vs. Credit**: Another possibility is that this table is comparing two different investment options: "ig" could represent an investment strategy or product, and "Créd" could refer to a credit instrument (e.g., bond) or a financial institution offering credits. The table might be highlighting the differences between these two investment options in terms of their returns, risks, or other key factors.
3. **Other possibilities**: Without more context, it's also possible that this text is related to a specific industry, such as banking or finance, where "ig" and "Créd" are abbreviations for specific concepts (e.g., insurance guaranty funds and credit guarantees). Alternatively, the table might be comparing two different approaches or methodologies within risk management.

To get a better understanding of this table, I would need more information about the context in which it appears, such as the title of the document, the industry or sector being discussed, or specific details about what "ig" and "Créd" represent. If you have any additional context or clarification on these points, I'd be happy to try and provide a more detailed explanation!
