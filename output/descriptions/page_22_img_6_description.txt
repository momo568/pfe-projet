I'm afraid I have some bad news!

The text you provided, "Aucun texte extrait de l'image," is French for "No text extracted from the image." This means that there is no actual text to work with, as the image does not contain any extractable text.

As a result, it's not possible to generate a detailed explanation of this figure based on the extracted text, since there is no text to extract in the first place!

If you could provide me with more context or information about the risk management document and the figure in question, I'd be happy to help you understand it better.
