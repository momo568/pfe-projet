I apologize, but since there is no extracted text, I cannot provide a detailed explanation of the figure. The phrase "Aucun texte extrait de l'image" is French for "No text extracted from the image", which means that there is no text available to base any kind of analysis or explanation on.

If you could provide me with the actual text or information related to the figure, I would be happy to help you generate a detailed explanation.
