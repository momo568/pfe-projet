I apologize, but since there is no text extracted from the image, I am unable to provide a detailed explanation of the figure. The statement "Aucun texte extrait de l'image" (which means "No text extracted from the image" in French) indicates that there is no text available for analysis.

If you could provide me with more information about the figure or the context in which it appears, I may be able to help you interpret the contents of the figure even without any text. Alternatively, if you have access to the original image, I can try to assist you in analyzing its elements and providing a detailed explanation.
