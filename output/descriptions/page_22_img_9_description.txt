I'm afraid I have some bad news!

As there is no text extracted from the image, it's not possible for me to provide a detailed explanation of the figure. The phrase "Aucun texte extrait de l'image" is French for "No text extracted from the image", indicating that there is no text available to work with.

In this case, I can't generate any information about the figure, as it's essentially an empty slate. If you'd like to provide more context or details about the figure, I'd be happy to try and help you understand it!
