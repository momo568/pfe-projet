I'm afraid I have some bad news!

The extracted text "Ss Differ" is not enough to generate a detailed explanation of a table, as it appears to be a single phrase that doesn't provide any information about the contents or structure of the table.

To provide a detailed explanation of this table, I would need more context and information about the table itself. For example:

* What are the columns and rows? Are they labeled?
* What is the purpose of the table? Is it showing data, risks, controls, or something else?
* Are there any specific risk categories or scenarios being addressed?

If you could provide more information about the table, I'd be happy to help generate a detailed explanation for you!
