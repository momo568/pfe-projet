I apologize, but since there is no text extracted from the image, I cannot generate a detailed explanation of the figure. The text "Aucun texte extrait de l'image" means "No text extracted from the image" in French.

If you could provide me with more context or information about the risk management document and the figure itself, I'd be happy to help you interpret it or provide a possible explanation based on its contents.
