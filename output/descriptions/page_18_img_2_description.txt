I apologize, but since there is no extracted text, I cannot provide a detailed explanation of the figure. The message "Aucun texte extrait de l'image." translates to "No text extracted from the image." in English.

It seems that the risk management document contains an image or figure without any accompanying text. Therefore, it's not possible for me to generate a detailed explanation based on this information.

If you could provide more context or clarify what the figure represents, I'd be happy to help you create a description or analysis of it!
