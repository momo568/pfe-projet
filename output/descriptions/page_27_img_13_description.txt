I'm afraid I have some bad news!

The text "Aucun texte extrait de l'image." means "No text extracted from the image" in French. This suggests that there is no actual text to work with, and therefore, it's not possible for me to generate a detailed explanation of this figure.

If you could provide more context or information about the figure, I'd be happy to try and help you understand it better!
