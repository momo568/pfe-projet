Based on the extracted text from the table figure in the risk management document, I can provide a detailed explanation of what each column and row likely represents:

**Columns:**

1. **ES**: This appears to be an abbreviation for "Expected Shortfall" or "ES", which is a measure of potential loss within a confidence interval. In risk management, Expected Shortfall (ES) is used to estimate the average loss that exceeds a given probability level.
2. **EC**: This could stand for "Expected Contribution" or "EC", which might represent the expected value of a specific risk factor or exposure.
3. **CO**: This likely stands for "Capital Outlay" or "CO", which would indicate the required capital to cover potential losses.

**Rows:**

1. **Po**: The row label "Po" is unclear without more context, but it might represent a specific portfolio, position, or scenario being evaluated.

**Data Values:**

The table appears to provide numerical values for each column and row combination:

* **ES EC CO**
	+ Po: 7 - This value likely represents the Expected Shortfall (ES) for the "Po" scenario.
	+ a: 173.50 - This could be an expected contribution or capital outlay value for the "a" scenario, but this label seems unclear.
	+ EC: 994.45 - Another expected contribution or capital outlay value.
	+ CO: 7174 - A larger capital outlay value.

Please note that without additional context, it's difficult to provide a more specific explanation of the table contents. The abbreviations and labels might have different meanings depending on the risk management framework or industry being used.
