I apologize, but it seems that there is no text to extract from the image. The phrase "Aucun texte extrait de l'image" is French for "No text extracted from the image". This means that the original document likely contained a visual representation (e.g., a graph, chart, or diagram) without any accompanying text.

As a result, I'm unable to provide a detailed explanation of the figure based on the extracted text, as there is no text available. If you could provide more context or information about the figure itself, I'd be happy to help with analyzing and interpreting it!
