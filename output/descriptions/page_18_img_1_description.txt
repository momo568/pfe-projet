I'm afraid I have some bad news!

The extracted text is simply "Aucun texte extrait de l'image." which means "No text extracted from the image" in French. This suggests that there was no text present in the original image, and therefore, there's nothing for me to generate a detailed explanation of.

If you could provide more context or information about the figure, I'd be happy to help with generating an explanation based on any available details.
