I apologize, but since there is no extracted text from the image, I cannot provide a detailed explanation of the figure. The provided text simply states that "Aucun texte extrait de l'image," which means "No text extracted from the image." This suggests that the original document does not contain any readable or extractable text related to the figure.

If you could provide more context or information about the figure, such as what type of risk management document it is from or what kind of data the figure represents, I may be able to help you interpret the figure even without the extracted text.
