I'm happy to help! However, I must point out that there is no text extracted from the image, which means I don't have any information to work with. The phrase "Aucun texte extrait de l'image" is French for "No text extracted from the image", indicating that there is no text available to analyze.

As a result, it's not possible to generate a detailed explanation of this figure based on the extracted text, since there is no text to begin with. If you could provide more information or context about the risk management document and the figure in question, I'd be happy to try and assist you further!
