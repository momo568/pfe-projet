I'm afraid I have some bad news!

The text "Aucun texte extrait de l'image" is French for "No text extracted from the image." This means that there is no actual text to extract from the image, which makes it impossible for me to generate a detailed explanation of the figure.

In other words, the risk management document likely contains an image or diagram that does not have any accompanying text. If you'd like, I can try to help you interpret the image itself, but without any context or explanatory text, it may be challenging to provide a detailed understanding of the figure.
