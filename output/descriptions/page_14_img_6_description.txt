I'm afraid I have some bad news!

As there is "Aucun texte extrait de l'image" (which means "No text extracted from the image"), it appears that there is no text associated with this figure in the risk management document.

In other words, there is no information to generate a detailed explanation of this figure. The text extraction process has failed to yield any relevant or meaningful information.

If you'd like, I can try to help you interpret the figure itself (assuming it's an image) or provide guidance on how to extract more text from the document. Just let me know!
