I apologize, but since there is no extracted text, I have nothing to work with! The message "Aucun texte extrait de l'image." translates to "No text extracted from the image." in English.

In other words, the risk management document doesn't provide any text that can be used as a basis for generating an explanation of a figure. If you could provide me with more information or context about the figure, I'd be happy to try and help you understand it!
