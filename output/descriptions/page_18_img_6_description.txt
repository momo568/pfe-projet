I apologize, but since there is no extracted text, I cannot generate a detailed explanation of the figure. The text "Aucun texte extrait de l'image" means "No text extracted from the image," indicating that there is no text available to analyze or interpret.

In this case, it's likely that the figure in the risk management document contains visual information, such as diagrams, charts, tables, or images, but does not have any accompanying text. If you'd like, I can try to help you understand the visual elements of the figure, but without any textual context, my ability to provide a detailed explanation is limited.
