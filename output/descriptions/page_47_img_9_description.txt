I apologize, but since there is no extracted text, I cannot provide a detailed explanation of the figure. The phrase "Aucun texte extrait de l'image" translates to "No text extracted from the image," indicating that there is no text available for analysis.

If you can provide me with more information about the risk management document or the figure itself, I may be able to help you understand its content and significance. Alternatively, if you have the actual figure or an accompanying description, I'd be happy to assist you in interpreting it.
