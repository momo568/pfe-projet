I apologize, but since there is no text extracted from the image, I cannot generate a detailed explanation of the figure. The text "Aucun texte extrait de l'image." literally means "No text extracted from the image" in French. It seems that the risk management document does not provide any information about the figure.

If you could provide me with more context or additional information about the figure, I'd be happy to help you understand it better.
