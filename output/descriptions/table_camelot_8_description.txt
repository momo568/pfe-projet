I apologize, but since there is no text extracted from the image, I cannot provide a detailed explanation of the table. The phrase "Aucun texte extrait de l'image" means "No text extracted from the image," indicating that there is no information available to work with.

To generate a detailed explanation of the table, we would need to know what the table contains, such as column headers, row values, and any relevant data or information. Without this information, it's not possible to provide an accurate or meaningful explanation.

If you could provide more context or clarify what the table is supposed to represent, I'd be happy to help you generate a detailed explanation once the text has been extracted!
