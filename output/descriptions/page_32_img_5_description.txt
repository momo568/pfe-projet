I'm afraid I have some bad news!

The text "Aucun texte extrait de l'image." means "No text extracted from the image" in French. This suggests that there is no text available to provide a detailed explanation for the figure.

In other words, there is no information about what the figure represents, what it shows, or what its purpose is. It's as if the figure is blank or empty!

If you have any additional context or information about the risk management document and the figure in question, I'd be happy to try and help you understand it better.
