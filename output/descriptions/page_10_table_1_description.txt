I'm happy to help! However, I must point out that the extracted text "Ss Differ" doesn't seem to provide much information about the table or its contents.

Without more context or details, it's challenging for me to generate a detailed explanation of this table. The text suggests that there might be some difference between two values or categories represented by the letters "Ss", but without further clarification, I can only speculate.

If you could provide more information about the table, such as:

1. What is the topic or theme of the table (e.g., risk assessment, mitigation strategies, etc.)?
2. What are the columns and rows in the table representing? Are there any headers or labels that would help me understand the data?
3. What kind of values or data points are being presented in the table (e.g., numerical, categorical, text-based)?

With more context, I'd be happy to help you generate a detailed explanation of this table!
