I'm afraid I have some bad news!

The text "Aucun texte extrait de l'image." literally translates to "No text extracted from the image." This means that there is no text available for me to work with, as the figure in the risk management document appears to be an image without any accompanying text.

As a result, I cannot generate a detailed explanation of this figure based on the extracted text, since there is no text to extract. If you could provide more context or clarify what the figure represents, I'd be happy to try and help you understand it!
