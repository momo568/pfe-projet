I apologize, but it appears that there is no text to extract from the image. The phrase "Aucun texte extrait de l'image" is French for "No text extracted from the image." This means that there is no text associated with the figure in the risk management document.

As a result, I am unable to generate a detailed explanation of this figure based on any extracted text. If you could provide me with more information about the figure or the context in which it appears, I may be able to help you understand its contents and significance.
