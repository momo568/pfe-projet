I'm afraid I have some bad news!

Since there is "Aucun texte extrait de l'image" (which means "No text extracted from the image"), that means there is no actual text to work with. In other words, there is no information to provide a detailed explanation of.

If you'd like, I can try to help you create a fictional figure or even generate a random text for us to work with! Just let me know what kind of risk management document this figure would be associated with (e.g., insurance, finance, environmental, etc.), and we can have some fun creating a hypothetical scenario together.
