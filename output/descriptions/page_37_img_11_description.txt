I apologize, but since there is no text extracted from the image, I cannot provide a detailed explanation of the figure. The phrase "Aucun texte extrait de l'image" is French for "No text extracted from the image," indicating that there is no relevant information to work with.

If you could provide more context or clarify what type of risk management document this figure is from, I may be able to help you interpret the visual elements or suggest ways to analyze the figure even without any extracted text.
