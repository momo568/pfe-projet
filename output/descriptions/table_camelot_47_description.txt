Here's a detailed explanation of the table:

**Definition du Revolving**

The first point defines what "Revolving" means. Unfortunately, the text does not provide a clear definition, but based on the context, it is likely that "Revolving" refers to a financial concept where a loan or credit facility is repaid periodically over time, rather than all at once.

**Le Calcul des intéréts**
