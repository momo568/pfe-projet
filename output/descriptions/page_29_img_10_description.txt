I apologize, but since there is no extracted text, I cannot generate a detailed explanation of the figure. The phrase "Aucun texte extrait de l'image" is French for "No text extracted from the image", indicating that there is no text or information available to analyze.

If you could provide me with the actual text or description associated with the figure, I would be happy to help you generate a detailed explanation!
