I'm afraid I have some bad news...

The text you provided doesn't actually contain any information that can be used to explain a figure from a risk management document. The phrase "Aucun texte extrait de l'image" is French for "No text extracted from the image", which means there is no text available to work with.

In this case, I'm unable to generate a detailed explanation of the figure as there is no information provided about what the figure even looks like, let alone its contents or significance in the context of risk management. If you could provide more context or clarify what the figure represents, I'd be happy to try and assist you further!
