I'm happy to help! However, I must point out that the provided text "Carrefour (&}" is quite minimal and doesn't seem to convey any specific information about a figure in a risk management document.

As there's no actual data or content to work with, it's challenging for me to generate a detailed explanation of this figure. The extracted text only contains a company name (Carrefour) followed by an unclear symbol (&}. It's possible that the "&}" is meant to represent something else, but without more context, it's difficult to determine what that might be.

If you could provide more information or clarify what the figure represents, I'd be happy to help you generate a detailed explanation!
