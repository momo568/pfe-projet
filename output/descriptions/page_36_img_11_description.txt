I'm afraid I have some bad news!

The extracted text "Aucun texte extrait de l'image." is actually French for "No text extracted from the image." This means that there is no text to extract from the image, and therefore, I cannot generate a detailed explanation of the figure based on any extracted text.

If you could provide me with more information about the risk management document or the figure itself, I'd be happy to try and help you understand it better.
