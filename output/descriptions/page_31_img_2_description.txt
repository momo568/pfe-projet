I apologize, but since there is no extracted text, I cannot provide a detailed explanation of the figure. The phrase "Aucun texte extrait de l'image" is French for "No text extracted from the image", which means that there is no text to work with.

If you could provide me with more information or context about the risk management document and the figure in question, I may be able to help you understand it better. Alternatively, if you can share an image of the figure, I'd be happy to try and analyze it for you.
