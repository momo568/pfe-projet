I'm afraid I have some bad news!

Since there is "Aucun texte extrait de l'image" (which means "No text extracted from the image"), it seems that there is no actual text to work with. This likely means that the risk management document does not contain any relevant information or data that can be used to generate a detailed explanation of the figure.

In this case, I won't be able to provide an explanation of the figure as there is no text to analyze. If you could provide more context or additional information about the figure, I may be able to help you better.
