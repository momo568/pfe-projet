I apologize, but it seems that the text "Moulinette de" is not sufficient to generate a detailed explanation of a table. This appears to be only part of a title or header in the table, and does not provide any information about the structure, content, or purpose of the table.

To provide a meaningful explanation, I would need more context or additional text from the table figure. Could you please provide more information or clarify what kind of risk management document this is and what topic it relates to?
