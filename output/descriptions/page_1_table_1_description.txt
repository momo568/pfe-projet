I'm happy to help! However, I must point out that the extracted text you provided appears to be incomplete and unclear. The table appears to have been truncated or corrupted, making it difficult for me to provide a detailed explanation.

Can you please provide more context or clarify what this table is supposed to represent? Additionally, if possible, could you provide the complete text from the table figure in the risk management document? This would allow me to better understand the contents and provide a more accurate explanation.
