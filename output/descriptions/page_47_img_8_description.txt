I apologize, but since there is no text extracted from the image, I cannot provide a detailed explanation of the figure. The phrase "Aucun texte extrait de l'image" means "No text extracted from the image" in French. It seems that the risk management document does not contain any text related to this specific figure.

If you could provide more context or additional information about the figure, I may be able to help you interpret it or generate a hypothetical explanation based on common risk management concepts.
