I apologize, but since there is no text extracted from the image, I cannot provide a detailed explanation of the figure. The phrase "Aucun texte extrait de l'image" translates to "No text extracted from the image," which means that there is no text available to work with.

In this case, it's likely that the original document only contains an image or diagram without any accompanying text. If you could provide more context or additional information about the figure, I may be able to help you create a detailed explanation based on other factors, such as the visual elements present in the image.
