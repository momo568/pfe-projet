I'm afraid I have some bad news!

The extracted text is "Aucun texte extrait de l'image." which is French for "No text extracted from the image". This means that there is no text to extract or work with, and therefore, it's not possible to generate a detailed explanation of this figure.

If you could provide me with more context or information about the risk management document and the figure in question, I'd be happy to help you analyze and understand it!
