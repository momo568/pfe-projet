I apologize, but since there is no text extracted from the image, I cannot generate a detailed explanation of the figure. The phrase "Aucun texte extrait de l'image" translates to "No text extracted from the image", indicating that there is no relevant information available for me to work with.

If you can provide more context or clarify what kind of risk management document this is, I may be able to offer some general insights or suggestions on how to approach a similar figure. Alternatively, if you have any additional information about the figure itself, such as its title, labels, or any other relevant details, I would be happy to try and assist you in interpreting it.
