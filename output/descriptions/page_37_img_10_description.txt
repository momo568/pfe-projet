I'm afraid I have some bad news!

The text "Aucun texte extrait de l'image" means that there is no text extracted from the image. In other words, there is no text to work with! This could be due to various reasons such as:

1. The figure doesn't contain any readable text.
2. The figure is an image only (e.g., a graph, chart, or diagram) and does not have any accompanying text.
3. There was an error in extracting the text from the image.

As a result, I'm unable to generate a detailed explanation of this figure based on the extracted text because... well, there is no text! If you could provide more context or clarify what you're looking for, I'd be happy to try and assist you further.
