I apologize, but since there is "Aucun texte" (which means "No text" in French), there is no extracted text to work with. As a result, I cannot provide a detailed explanation of the figure.

If you can provide me with more context or information about the risk management document and the figure itself, I may be able to help you understand its contents. Alternatively, if you have the image file (e.g., a PDF or JPEG), I can try to assist you in interpreting the visual data.
