I'm afraid I have some bad news!

The text you provided, "Aucun texte extrait de l'image," is French for "No text extracted from the image." This means that there is no actual text to work with, as it appears that the figure in question is an image-only component without any associated textual content.

As a result, I'm unable to generate a detailed explanation of this figure based on the extracted text, since there is no text to extract or analyze! If you could provide more context or clarify what kind of information you're looking for, I'd be happy to try and assist you further.
