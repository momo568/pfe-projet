I'm afraid I have some bad news!

Since there is "Aucun texte" (French for "No text") extracted from the image, it means that there is no text in the table figure to provide a detailed explanation about. The risk management document does not appear to contain any textual information that can be analyzed or summarized.

If you could provide more context or additional details about the table figure, I may be able to help you understand what kind of data or information it contains, even without any text.
