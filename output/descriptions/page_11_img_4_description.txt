I'm afraid I have some bad news!

Since there's no text extracted from the image, I won't be able to provide a detailed explanation of the figure. The phrase "Aucun texte extrait de l'image" is French for "No text extracted from the image", which means that there is no text available to work with.

If you can provide me with more context or information about the risk management document, I'd be happy to help you analyze the figure and provide a detailed explanation.
