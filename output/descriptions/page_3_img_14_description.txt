I apologize, but since there is no extracted text, I cannot provide a detailed explanation of the figure. The phrase "Aucun texte extrait de l'image" translates to "No text extracted from the image," which means that there is no text available for analysis or interpretation.

If you could provide me with more information about the risk management document and the figure in question, I may be able to help you understand what it represents. Alternatively, if you can extract any relevant text or provide additional context, I'd be happy to try and assist you further!
