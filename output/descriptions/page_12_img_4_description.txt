I apologize, but since there is no extracted text, I cannot generate a detailed explanation of the figure. The phrase "Aucun texte extrait de l'image" means that there is no text extracted from the image, implying that the risk management document does not contain any written information about the figure.

If you could provide me with more context or clarify what type of figure this is (e.g., a chart, graph, diagram), I may be able to help you create an explanation based on my understanding and assumptions.
