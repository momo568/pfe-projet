I'm afraid I have some bad news!

Since there is "Aucun texte" (French for "No text") extracted from the image, it means that there is no text associated with the figure in the risk management document.

As a result, I cannot generate a detailed explanation of this figure based on the extracted text, as there is none to work with!

If you'd like to provide me with more information or context about the figure, I'd be happy to try and help you understand it.
