I apologize, but since there is no extracted text, I cannot generate a detailed explanation of the table. The text "Aucun texte extrait de l'image" means that no text was extracted from the image, likely indicating that the table contains only images or data and does not include any written text.

If you can provide me with more information about the table, such as its contents, columns, or rows, I'd be happy to help you generate a detailed explanation. Alternatively, if you have access to the original document or image, you may want to try extracting the text using optical character recognition (OCR) software or by copying and pasting the text from the image.
