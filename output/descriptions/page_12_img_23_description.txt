I'm afraid I have some bad news!

The text "Aucun texte extrait de l'image." means that there is no text extracted from the image, which implies that there is no text to work with. In other words, the risk management document does not contain any text that can be used as a basis for generating an explanation of the figure.

If you'd like, I can try to help you create a hypothetical explanation based on your understanding of what the figure might represent or what it could mean in the context of risk management. Just let me know!
