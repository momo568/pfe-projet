I apologize, but since there is no text extracted from the image, I cannot generate a detailed explanation of the figure. The phrase "Aucun texte extrait de l'image" is French for "No text extracted from the image," indicating that there is no textual information available to provide an explanation.

If you could provide more context or clarify what type of risk management document this figure is from, I may be able to assist you in generating a detailed explanation based on other information.
