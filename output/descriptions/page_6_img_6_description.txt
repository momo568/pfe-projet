I'm happy to help! However, I must point out that the extracted text "Bon @ savoir!" doesn't seem to provide any information that can be used to generate a detailed explanation of a figure in a risk management document.

The text appears to be a playful phrase with no apparent connection to risk management or statistics. It's possible that there might have been an error in extracting the text from the figure, or perhaps it's meant to be humorous or thought-provoking rather than providing actual data.

If you could provide more context or clarify what type of information is typically included in a figure in a risk management document, I'd be happy to try and assist you further.
