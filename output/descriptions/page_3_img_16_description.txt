I'm happy to help! However, since there is no extracted text, I won't be able to provide a detailed explanation of the figure. It seems that the risk management document doesn't contain any relevant information about the figure.

Could you please provide me with more context or additional information about the figure? For example, what kind of risk management document is this from (e.g., insurance, financial, IT)? What type of risk is being managed (e.g., natural disaster, cyber attack)? Any details you can provide will help me better understand your request and generate a more accurate response.
