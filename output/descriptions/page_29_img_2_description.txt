I apologize, but since there is no extracted text from the image, I'm unable to provide a detailed explanation of the figure. The text "Aucun texte extrait de l'image" literally means "No text extracted from the image", indicating that there is no text available to analyze or interpret.

If you could provide me with more context or information about the risk management document and the figure in question, I may be able to help you understand it better. Alternatively, if you have a description or additional context about the figure, I'd be happy to try and generate an explanation for you!
