I'm afraid I have some bad news!

Since there is "No text extracted from the image", that means we don't actually have any information to work with. In other words, the figure doesn't contain any text or data that can be used to create a detailed explanation.

If you'd like to provide more context or information about the figure itself (e.g., what type of risk management document it's from, what kind of data it might contain), I'd be happy to try and help you generate a hypothetical explanation. Just let me know!
