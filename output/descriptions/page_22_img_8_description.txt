I'm afraid I have some bad news!

The extracted text is simply "Aucun texte extrait de l'image.", which means "No text extracted from the image." in French. This implies that there is no text available to generate a detailed explanation of the figure.

In other words, the risk management document doesn't provide any information about the figure, and therefore, I can't provide an explanation for you. If you'd like, I can try to help you with something else!
