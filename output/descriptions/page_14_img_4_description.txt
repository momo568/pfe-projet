I apologize, but since there is no extracted text, I cannot generate a detailed explanation of the figure. The phrase "Aucun texte extrait de l'image" is French for "No text extracted from the image," indicating that there is no text available to work with.

In order to provide a detailed explanation of the figure, I would need some text or information about the figure itself, such as its title, labels, and any relevant data or metrics. If you could provide me with more context or information about the figure, I would be happy to try and help you understand it better.
