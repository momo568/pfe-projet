I apologize, but since there is no text extracted from the image, I cannot provide a detailed explanation of the figure. The text "Aucun texte extrait de l'image" means "No text extracted from the image" in French, indicating that there is no relevant information to work with.

If you could provide me with more context or clarify what kind of risk management document this is, I may be able to offer some general insights or ask follow-up questions to better understand the figure. However, without any text, it's challenging to generate a detailed explanation.
