Unfortunately, I cannot provide a detailed explanation of this table as there is not enough information provided to do so. The text appears to be in French and mentions "Cebit Classiques", which may refer to a specific risk management framework or methodology. Additionally, the text mentions "Principe e Rises de Gestion" which seems to be related to principles of asset management.

The last line mentions "Les Types 'amortissement d'un eréitbancaire" which appears to be a type of depreciation method for financial institutions (eréitbancaire).

To provide a detailed explanation, I would need more information on the context and the structure of the table. If you can provide more details or context about this table, I'd be happy to help.
