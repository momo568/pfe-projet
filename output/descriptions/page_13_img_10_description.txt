I apologize, but there is no extracted text to work with! The phrase "Aucun texte extrait de l'image" is French for "No text extracted from the image". This means that there is no text available to provide a detailed explanation of the figure.

If you could provide me with the actual text or information about the figure, I'd be happy to help you create a detailed explanation!
