I'm afraid I have some bad news!

The text "Aucun texte extrait de l'image." translates to "No text extracted from the image." in English. This means that there is no text available for me to work with, and therefore, I cannot generate a detailed explanation of this figure.

In other words, it seems that the risk management document you're referring to doesn't have any textual information associated with the figure. The figure might be an image, a diagram, or some other graphical representation, but without any accompanying text, there's not much I can do to provide more context about what it represents.
