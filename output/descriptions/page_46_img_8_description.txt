I apologize, but there is no extracted text to generate a detailed explanation for! The phrase "Aucun texte extrait de l'image" is French for "No text extracted from the image". It seems that there is no actual text or information available to work with.

In this case, I cannot provide a detailed explanation of a figure since there is no information to draw from. If you could provide me with more context or clarify what type of risk management document this is, I'd be happy to help in any way I can!
