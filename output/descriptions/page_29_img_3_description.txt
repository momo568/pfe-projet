I apologize, but since there is no extracted text, I cannot generate a detailed explanation of the figure. The phrase "Aucun texte extrait de l'image" translates to "No text extracted from the image," indicating that there is no text available to analyze or explain.

If you can provide me with the actual figure or any relevant information about it, I'd be happy to help you understand what it represents and its significance in the context of risk management.
