I'm afraid I have some bad news!

Since there is "no text extracted from the image," that means there is no text to work with, and therefore, it's not possible for me to generate a detailed explanation of the figure.

If you could provide more context or information about the figure itself (e.g., what type of risk management document it is from, what industry or field it pertains to, etc.), I may be able to help you interpret the figure based on its visual elements and layout.
