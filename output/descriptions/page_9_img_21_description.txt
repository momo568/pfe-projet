I'm afraid I have some bad news!

Since there is "Aucun texte extrait de l'image," which means "No text extracted from the image" in French, it appears that there is no text associated with this figure. This likely means that the figure consists only of visual elements, such as charts, graphs, tables, or images, without any accompanying written descriptions or explanations.

As a result, I'm unable to generate a detailed explanation of this figure based on extracted text, as there is none to work with! If you could provide more context or information about the figure, I'd be happy to try and help you understand it better.
