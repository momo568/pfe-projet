I'm afraid I have some bad news!

The text you provided, "Aucun texte extrait de l'image," is French for "No text extracted from the image." This means that there is no actual text associated with the figure in the risk management document.

As a result, I am unable to generate a detailed explanation of this figure based on any extracted text. The figure itself may still contain relevant information, but without any accompanying text, it's not possible for me to provide an explanation.
