I apologize, but there seems to be an issue here! Since "Aucun texte extrait de l'image." means "No text extracted from the image", it appears that there is no actual text to work with. In other words, the risk management document does not contain any extractable information.

As a result, I cannot generate a detailed explanation of this figure based on the extracted text, as there is no text to begin with!
