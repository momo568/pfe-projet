Unfortunately, it seems that the provided text does not contain enough information to generate a detailed explanation of the table. The text appears to be incomplete and lacks any specific details about the two options being compared: Leasing vs Cr√©dits.

To create a meaningful explanation, I would need more context and information about what is being leased or credited, the relevant risks involved, and how these two alternatives are being evaluated for risk management purposes.

If you could provide additional text from the table figure, such as column headings, rows with specific data points, or more descriptive text, I would be happy to help create a detailed explanation of the table.
