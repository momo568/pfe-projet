I apologize, but there is no extracted text to work with! The phrase "Aucun texte extrait de l'image" means "No text extracted from the image," which is likely because the original document was an image or diagram, and not a written text.

In this case, I cannot generate a detailed explanation of the figure based on the extracted text because there is no text to work with.
