I'm afraid I have some bad news!

As there is "Aucun texte" (which means "No text" in French), it's not possible for me to generate a detailed explanation of the figure, as there is no information to work with.

It seems that the risk management document only contains an image without any accompanying text. If you could provide more context or information about the figure, I'd be happy to help you understand what it represents!
