I'm happy to help! However, I must point out that the text you provided doesn't seem to be related to any specific table or topic. The words "ette" and "istique" don't appear to be relevant or meaningful in the context of a risk management document.

Could you please provide more information about the table, such as:

1. What type of risk is being managed (e.g., operational, financial, strategic)?
2. Who is the intended audience for this risk assessment?
3. Are there any specific industries, sectors, or organizations being considered?
4. Is there a particular geographic region or scope being assessed?

Once I have more context, I can try to generate a detailed explanation of the table based on the extracted text.
