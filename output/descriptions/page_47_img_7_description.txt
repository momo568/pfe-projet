I'm afraid I have some bad news!

The text "Aucun texte extrait de l'image." means "No text extracted from the image." in French. This suggests that there is no text or information available to generate an explanation for a figure, as it appears to be a blank or empty box.

In other words, there is no information provided about the figure, its content, or any relevant details. It's like trying to explain a picture with no context or description!

If you can provide more context or information about the risk management document and the figure in question, I'd be happy to help generate an explanation based on available data.
