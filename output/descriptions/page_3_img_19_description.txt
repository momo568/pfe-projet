I apologize, but since there is no extracted text, I have nothing to work with! The phrase "Aucun texte extrait de l'image" is French for "No text extracted from the image", indicating that there is no text or information to summarize.

If you could provide me with more context or the actual figure, I'd be happy to help generate a detailed explanation of it.
