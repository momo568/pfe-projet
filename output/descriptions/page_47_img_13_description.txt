I apologize, but since there is no extracted text from the image, I am unable to provide a detailed explanation of the figure. The phrase "Aucun texte extrait de l'image" translates to "No text extracted from the image," indicating that there is no textual information available for analysis.

If you could provide me with more context or additional information about the risk management document and the figure, I would be happy to try and help you understand it. Alternatively, if you have any specific questions or concerns about risk management, I'm here to assist you.
