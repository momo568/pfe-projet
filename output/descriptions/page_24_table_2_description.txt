I'm afraid I have some bad news!

The extracted text "rette de Ce" doesn't seem to be a meaningful or interpretable piece of information. It appears to be a random combination of characters, possibly an error or corruption in the original document.

As a result, it's not possible for me to generate a detailed explanation of this table based on the extracted text, as there is no underlying data or structure to work with.

If you could provide more context or clarify what this text is supposed to represent, I'd be happy to try and assist you further!
