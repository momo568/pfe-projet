I'm afraid I have some bad news!

Since there was "no text extracted from the image", it means that there is no information to work with, and therefore, I cannot generate a detailed explanation of this figure.

In other words, the risk management document appears to be an image-only entry, without any accompanying text or data. This makes it impossible for me (or anyone else) to provide a meaningful description or analysis of the figure.

If you'd like to share more information about the context or content of the image, I'd be happy to try and help you interpret it!
