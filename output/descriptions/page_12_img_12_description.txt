I apologize, but since there is no text extracted from the image, I'm unable to provide a detailed explanation of the figure. The phrase "Aucun texte extrait de l'image" is French for "No text extracted from the image", indicating that there is no text or information available to work with.

In this case, it's likely that the risk management document refers to an image or diagram without any accompanying text or captions. If you could provide more context or additional information about the figure, I'd be happy to try and assist you in interpreting it!
