I apologize, but it appears that the extracted text "de bases Cc" does not provide enough information to generate a detailed explanation of a table.

The text seems to be incomplete or unclear, as it only contains three words: "de bases Cc". Without more context or information about what this text represents in the risk management document, I am unable to provide a meaningful analysis or interpretation of the data.

Could you please provide additional details or clarify what this text is supposed to represent?
