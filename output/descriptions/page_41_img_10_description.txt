I'm afraid I have some bad news!

The text you provided is actually "Aucun texte extrait de l'image", which means "No text extracted from the image" in French. This suggests that there is no actual text to extract, as the image itself does not contain any written content.

As a result, it's not possible for me to generate a detailed explanation of this figure based on the extracted text, since there is no text to work with.

If you could provide more context or information about the risk management document and the figure in question, I'd be happy to try and help you analyze and interpret it!
