I apologize, but it seems that there is no text to extract from the image! The phrase "Aucun texte extrait de l'image" is French for "No text extracted from the image." This means that there is no written content or information provided in the figure, making it impossible to generate a detailed explanation based on the extracted text.

In this case, I can offer some suggestions:

1. Check if you have the correct document: Ensure that you are working with the intended risk management document and not a different file.
2. Review the document's contents: Go through the entire document again to see if there are any relevant sections or tables that might provide valuable information about the figure.
3. Contact the document creator: Reach out to the person who created the document to ask for clarification on the purpose of the figure, its contents, and any related information.

If you have any additional context or details, I'd be happy to help you investigate further!
