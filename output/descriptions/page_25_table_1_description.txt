I'm afraid I have some bad news!

The extracted text "Moulinette c" doesn't seem to provide any meaningful information about the table, as it appears to be a random sequence of characters. It's possible that the text is a mistake or an error in the document.

Without more context or information, I can't generate a detailed explanation of the table based on this extracted text. Can you please provide more details about the table, such as its contents, purpose, and any relevant headers or labels? That would help me better understand what you're looking for.
