I'm afraid I have some bad news!

The text "Aucun texte extrait de l'image" means "No text extracted from the image" in French. It appears that there is no actual text to work with, as the figure does not contain any text that can be extracted or analyzed.

In this case, it's not possible for me to generate a detailed explanation of the figure based on the extracted text, as there is no text to extract!
