I apologize, but since there is no text extracted from the image, I cannot provide a detailed explanation of the figure. The text "Aucun texte extrait de l'image" literally means "No text extracted from the image," indicating that there is no text to work with.

If you could provide me with more context or information about the image itself, such as its content or purpose, I may be able to help you interpret it in some way. Alternatively, if you have any additional text or information related to the risk management document, I would be happy to try and assist you in understanding the figure.
