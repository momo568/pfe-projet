I'm afraid I have some bad news!

The extracted text is "Aucun texte extrait de l'image." which means "No text extracted from the image" in French. This suggests that there is no actual text to extract from the image, and therefore, it's not possible to generate a detailed explanation of this figure.

If you could provide me with more context or information about the risk management document and the figure itself, I'd be happy to try and help you understand what it might represent.
