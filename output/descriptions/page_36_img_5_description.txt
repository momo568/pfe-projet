I apologize, but since there is no extracted text, I have nothing to work with! The phrase "Aucun texte extrait de l'image" means "No text extracted from the image" in French, indicating that there is no text available to provide a detailed explanation of the figure.

If you could provide me with the actual text or description associated with the figure, I'd be happy to help generate a detailed explanation for you!
