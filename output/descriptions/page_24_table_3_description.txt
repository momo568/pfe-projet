I'm happy to help! However, I must point out that the extracted text "Caract√©ristiques du cr" doesn't provide much information about the table itself. It appears to be a French phrase that translates to "Characteristics of Cr" or "Features of Cr", where "Cr" is likely an abbreviation or acronym.

Without more context or additional information, it's challenging for me to generate a detailed explanation of the table. Can you please provide more details about the table, such as:

1. What does "Cr" refer to (e.g., credit risk, country risk, etc.)?
2. What type of data is presented in the table (e.g., financial metrics, risk scores, etc.)?
3. Are there any specific columns or rows that you'd like me to focus on?

Once I have more context, I'll do my best to provide a detailed explanation of the table based on the extracted text!
