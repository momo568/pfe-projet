I apologize, but it seems that there is no text to extract from the image. The text you provided says "Aucun texte extrait de l'image," which is French for "No text extracted from the image." This means that there is no information or data available to generate a detailed explanation of the figure.

In this case, I would recommend seeking more information about the risk management document and the figure in question. You may need to consult with the authors or creators of the document to obtain additional context or details about the figure. Alternatively, you could try to infer what the figure might represent based on its location within the document and any surrounding text that provides context.
