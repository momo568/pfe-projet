I'm afraid I have some bad news!

Since there is "Aucun texte" (which means "No text" in French), it seems that there is no extractable text from the image, which makes it impossible for me to generate a detailed explanation of this figure.

In other words, the risk management document appears to be an image-only representation, without any accompanying text or labels. Without any context or information about what the figure represents, I'm unable to provide a meaningful explanation.

If you could provide more context or information about the figure, I'd be happy to help!
