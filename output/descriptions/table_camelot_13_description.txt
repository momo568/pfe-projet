Based on the extracted text, it appears that the table is discussing different types of credits and their principles of management. Here's a possible breakdown:

**Title:** Les Ditférents Types de Créits (Different Types of Credits)

The table seems to be divided into two main sections: "Principe e Rises de Gestion" (Principles and Risks of Management) and "Les Types d'amortissement d'un eréitbancaire" (Types of Amortization of a Bank Credit).

**Principe e Rises de Gestion (Principles and Risks of Management)**

This section likely outlines the key principles and risks associated with managing different types of credits. The text mentions "Principe e Rises," which could refer to the fundamental principles and potential risks or challenges that arise when managing credits.

**Les Types d'amortissement d'un eréitbancaire (Types of Amortization of a Bank Credit)**

This section appears to focus on the different types of amortization methods used for bank credits. "Amortissement" is French for "amortization," which refers to the process of gradually reducing the value or amount of a debt over time.

Some possible interpretations of this section include:

1. Different methods of calculating interest and principal payments, such as linear amortization, exponential amortization, or bullet amortization.
2. Types of credit products, like fixed-rate loans, variable-rate loans, or credit lines, with varying amortization schedules.
3. Risk management strategies for different types of credits, such as hedging, diversification, or collateralization.

Without more context or information about the specific table and document, it's difficult to provide a more detailed explanation. However, this breakdown should give you a general idea of what the table might be discussing.
