I'm afraid I have some bad news!

Since there is "no text extracted from the image", it means that the image doesn't contain any text that can be read or understood. Therefore, I cannot generate a detailed explanation of this figure based on the extracted text.

In other words, we don't have enough information to create an explanation because there are no words to work with!

If you'd like to provide more context or describe what's in the image, I'd be happy to help you generate an explanation. Just let me know!
