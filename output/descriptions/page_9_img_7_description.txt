I'm afraid I have some bad news!

Since there is "aucun texte" (no text) extracted from the image, I cannot generate a detailed explanation of the figure. The risk management document appears to be an image-only section, without any accompanying text or description.

If you'd like, I can try to help you brainstorm ways to analyze or interpret the image itself, if that's possible given its content and context. Alternatively, you may need to consult with the author or creator of the risk management document for further information about the figure.
