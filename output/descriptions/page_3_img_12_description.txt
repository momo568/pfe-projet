I apologize, but there seems to be an issue! The extracted text is "Aucun texte extrait de l'image." which means "No text extracted from the image" in French. This suggests that there is no text or information available to work with.

In this case, I won't be able to generate a detailed explanation of the figure since there's no information provided. If you can provide more context or clarify what kind of document this is and if there's any additional information, I'd be happy to try and help further!
