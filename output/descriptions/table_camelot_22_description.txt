Unfortunately, I must inform you that the text you provided is not sufficient to create a detailed explanation of the table. The text appears to be in French and consists of three phrases:

1. "Cebit Classiques"
2. "Principe e Rises de Gestion" (which seems to be a typo and should read " Principes et Règles de Gestion")
3. "Les Types 'amortissement d'un eréitbancaire"

The text does not provide any information about the columns, rows, or content of the table. Therefore, I cannot generate a detailed explanation based on this text.

If you could provide more context or information about the table, such as the number of columns and rows, the headings, or some sample data, I would be happy to help create a detailed explanation for you.
