I'm afraid I have some bad news!

The text you provided doesn't contain any actual text, so there's nothing to extract or base a detailed explanation on. The phrase "Aucun texte extrait de l'image" is French for "No text extracted from the image", which suggests that the figure in question is an image-only representation and doesn't have any accompanying text.

In this case, I can't provide a detailed explanation of the figure as there's no information to work with. If you could provide more context or a different figure with actual text, I'd be happy to help!
