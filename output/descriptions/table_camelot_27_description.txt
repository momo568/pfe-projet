Based on the provided text, it appears to be a partial extract from a table figure in a risk management document. The text is unclear and lacks formatting, making it difficult to decipher the exact structure and content of the original table. However, I'll attempt to provide an interpretation of the extracted text:

**Column 1: PF bento desc**

The first column seems to be labeled "PF bento desc," which could be a heading or title for this section. The term "bento" might refer to a Japanese-style lunchbox or container, and "desc" likely stands for "description." This column may contain descriptions related to risk management, possibly categorizing different types of risks or describing specific risk scenarios.

**Column 2: ee ns tes Oiferents types de ret**

The second column appears to be a combination of letters and symbols. The term "ee" might be an abbreviation or code, while "ns" could indicate a connection or relationship between the items listed in this column. The phrase "Oiferents types de ret" seems to describe different types of returns (perhaps financial) or possibly risk-related outcomes.

**Column 3: ee tes credits Classiques Fs**

The third column appears to be labeled with a mix of codes and phrases. The term "ee" is repeated, possibly indicating an abbreviation for "expected outcome" or "evaluation." The phrase "credits Classiques Fs" might refer to classic credit types or financial instruments.

**Column 4: ee en Percpe wees**

The fourth column contains seemingly unrelated text, including the words "ee," "en," "Percpe," and "wees." It's unclear what this column represents in the original table.

**Column 5: ee ee ieee’**

This column appears to be a continuation of the codes and abbreviations found in earlier columns. The term "ieee'" is likely an abbreviation, possibly referring to Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers or a similar organization.

**Column 6: ns Anes ees cetenena**

The sixth column contains more codes and abbreviations, including "ns," "Anes," and "cetenena." It's unclear what these terms relate to in the context of risk management.

**Column 7: es en —_eKR**

The final column appears to be a mix of letters and symbols. The term "es" might refer to evaluation or estimation, while "_eKR" could indicate an abbreviation or code for a specific type of risk or outcome.

In conclusion, the extracted text is likely a partial representation of a table figure in a risk management document. Due to the unclear formatting and lack of context, it's challenging to provide a detailed explanation of this table without more information about the original table structure and content.
