I'm afraid I have some bad news!

The extracted text is simply "Aucun texte extrait de l'image." which translates to "No text extracted from the image."

This means that there is no actual text present in the figure, and therefore, it's not possible for me to generate a detailed explanation of this figure based on the extracted text.

If you could provide more context or information about the figure itself, I'd be happy to try and assist you further!
