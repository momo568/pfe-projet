I'm happy to help! However, I must inform you that there is no text extracted from the image, which means I don't have any information to work with. The phrase "Aucun texte extrait de l'image" translates to "No text extracted from the image", indicating that there is no textual content available for me to analyze and generate an explanation.

In this case, I can't provide a detailed explanation of the figure since it's empty. If you could provide more context or information about the risk management document, I'd be happy to help with any questions or concerns you may have!
