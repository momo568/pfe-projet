I apologize, but since the extracted text only contains the word "Moulin", it's not possible to generate a detailed explanation of a table based on this information.

Typically, a table figure in a risk management document would contain data and information related to risks, their likelihood, impact, mitigation strategies, and other relevant details. Without any additional context or data, I cannot create an explanation for you.

If you could provide more information about the table, such as the type of risk being managed (e.g., financial, operational, strategic), the industry or sector involved, or the specific risks being addressed, I may be able to help you better. Alternatively, if you have any additional text that accompanies the "Moulin" label, please share it with me and I'll do my best to assist you.
