I'm afraid I have some bad news!

The extracted text "Aucun texte extrait de l'image" is French for "No text extracted from the image". This means that there is no actual text associated with the figure, so I can't generate a detailed explanation of it.

In other words, the risk management document doesn't provide any information about the figure, and we're left without any context or content to work with.
