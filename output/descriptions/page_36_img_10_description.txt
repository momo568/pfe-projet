I'm afraid I have some bad news...

The extracted text is simply "Aucun texte extrait de l'image." which means "No text extracted from the image" in French. This suggests that there is no text available to generate a detailed explanation of the figure.

In other words, there is no information provided about the figure, so it's not possible for me (or anyone else) to create a detailed explanation based on this text.
