I'm afraid I have some bad news!

The message "Aucun texte extrait de l'image" translates to "No text extracted from the image". This means that there is no text associated with the figure, and therefore, I cannot generate a detailed explanation of the figure based on an extracted text.

In other words, the risk management document does not provide any additional information about the figure beyond its presence in the document. If you'd like to provide more context or clarify what the figure represents, I'd be happy to try and help!
