I apologize, but since there is no extracted text, I cannot provide a detailed explanation of the figure. The phrase "Aucun texte extrait de l'image" translates to "No text extracted from the image," indicating that there is no text available for analysis or interpretation.

If you could provide me with more context or information about the risk management document and the figure in question, I'd be happy to try and assist you further.
